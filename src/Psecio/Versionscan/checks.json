            "summary": "PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the Apache HTTP Server. A memory corruption flaw was found in the way the openssl_x509_parse() function of the PHP openssl extension parsed X.509 certificates. A remote attacker could use this flaw to provide a malicious self-signed certificate or a certificate signed by a trusted authority to a PHP application using the aforementioned function, causing the application to crash or, possibly, allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the PHP interpreter.",
